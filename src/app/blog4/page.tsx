                <p className="font-sans text-base p-7">Embracing eco-friendly habits at home is easier than you may think, and small changes can make a big impact. Start by using energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances. This not only reduces electricity bills but also contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle. Recycling is another great step; set up designated bins for recyclables and focus on reducing single-use plastics by opting for reusable bags, bottles, and containers.Growing a few plants at home is a simple yet impactful way to go green. Plants naturally purify indoor air and add a refreshing touch to your living space. Composting organic waste is another eco-friendly habit that not only reduces waste but also creates natural fertilizer for plants. These small green changes contribute positively to the environment, making your home a more sustainable space.
