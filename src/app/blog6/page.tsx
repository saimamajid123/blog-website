                <p className="font-sans text-base p-7">With a busy lifestyle, it's easy to fall into the habit of unhealthy snacking. However, there are many healthy, convenient snack options that will keep you energized throughout the day. Nuts like almonds and walnuts are nutrient-rich and portable, while fruits such as apples, bananas, and berries provide vitamins and antioxidants. Greek yogurt is another excellent option, as itâ€™s high in protein and can be topped with fruits or nuts for extra flavor.Meal-prepping your snacks for the week can be a game-changer. Preparing hummus and veggie sticks, boiled eggs, or smoothie bowls in advance saves time and helps you make healthier choices during a hectic day. These nutrient-dense snacks keep you full, maintain energy levels, and prevent unhealthy cravings. Choosing these healthy options can greatly improve your overall health and productivity.
